# Optional challenge assignment


Verify that a file exists in the courseware VM called `/usr/share/dict/words`.  What's in it?

(Note: if this file doesn't exist, you can install it on Ubuntu 14 by typing `sudo apt-get install --reinstall wamerican`.  On other distributions or non-Linux versions of Unix, the file may be  [elsewhere](http://objectroot.org/articles/brief-history-of-hier/), or absent. 

> This file has been part of Unix since almost 
> [the beginning of time](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time).
> It has been used by programs ranging from spelling
> checkers to password guessers.

<summary>Why do you think we used a remote SOA endpoint to generate random words for Wordguesser rather than <code>/usr/share/dict/words</code>?  (Hint: It's not simply to give you an initial taste of using SOA.)</summary>
<p><blockquote>In many hosted deployment environments, you cannot rely on the
presence of the local filesystem, and in shared environments such as
Heroku you may not have access to the filesystem at all.  All state
must be stored in managed storage such as a database or other per-app
abstraction, or managed on remote servers.

Using Sinatra, create and deploy locally (on your computer) a *SOA endpoint* that mimics the behavior of the Random Word Generator service we used in this assignment.  A simple implementation would respond to the RESTful request `GET /` with a random word drawn randomly from `/usr/share/dict/words`.
